        <h3><u>The War in North Africa</u></h3>

        <p>New Zealand troops began arriving in Egypt in February 1940. The First Echelon of the 2nd New Zealand
            Expeditionary Force (2 N.Z.E.F.) formed after New Zealand declared war on Germany in September 1939
            established a large camp at Maadi, 12 km south of Cairo. Another smaller camp was set up 12 km further south
            at Helwan.</p>

        <p>Fighting in North Africa stemmed from the area's strategic importance to the Commonwealth. Egypt's SUEZ Canal
            connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, was a vital transport artery, while the Middle East
            oilfields were crucial to sustaining the Allied war effort. Italy's decision to enter the war in 1940
            alongside Germany, seriously jeopardised the British' position in Egypt. Italian forces in Libya and
            Abyssinia (Ethiopia) dwarfed the 36,000 British troops in the region. This threat became real when 250,000
            Italian troops crossed the Libyan border into Egypt in September 1940.</p>

        <h3><u>The 2 N.Z.E.F. in Egypt</u></h3>

        <p>The main fighting element of 2 N.Z.E.F. was the 16,000-strong 2nd New Zealand division. The Division was
            commanded by First World War Victoria Cross (V.C.) winner, Major-General Bernard 'Tiny' Freyberg who also
            commanded 2 N.Z.E.F. After returning to Egypt following the disastrous campaigns in Greece and Crete, the
            New Zealand Division entered the fray in North Africa during Operation Crusader in November 1941. For the
            next year, they saw action in the western part of Egypt, with several forays into Libya</p>

        <h3><u>El Alamein Train Station</u></h3>

        <p>Alongside the Division's field engineers, who excelled in the desert fighting, other specialist support units
            played a vital role in transporting and supplying allied forces, a challenging task given the huge distances
            and harsh environment. By the end of 1940 seven New Zealand railway units were operating in Egypt, including
            railway construction, survey and operating companies.</p>

        <h3><u>General Erwin Rommel</u></h3>

        <p>The New Zealanders saw little action during the initial stages of the North African campaign. Most of the
            fighting took place between the Western Desert Force (composed of British, Indian and Australian troops) and
            Italian forces. British and Commonwealth troops did not think much of their 'Itie' opponents. Some units
            fought well, but in general the Italians were badly equipped and poorly led. Many Italian troops were
            ambivalent about fighting on the German side and unwilling to give their lives for a cause in which they did
            not believe.</p>

        <p>In February 1941 the first elements of the Deutsches Afrika Korps (German Africa Corps) arrived to bolster
            the Italians, then reeling from a series of Allied blows. Commanded by General Erwin Rommel, an officer
            whose bold tactics earned him the moniker "Desert FOX". This small force soon made its mark in the campaign.
        </p>

        <h4><u>Life in the desert</u></h4>

        <p>Conditions in the desert were very tough. Cold nights and searing daytime temperatures made life
            uncomfortable for soldiers in forward position. Shade was hard to find and makeshift shelters did little to
            block the sun. Sandstorms were a regular hazard, and dust stirred up by vehicles and shellfire covered
            everything.</p>

        <p>The lack of drinking water, let alone water to wash, or shave in was a constant source of annoyance. So were
            the flies! Desperate for moisture, they settled on lips, or sweaty shirts by the hundreds. During daylight
            hours men struggled to eat as flies swarmed on their food, or dived into their drinks. One inevitable result
            was dysentery, a miserable experience. Mosquitoes were less prevalent but more lethal, for in most areas
            they transmitted malaria. Adding to the soldier's misery were desert sores, with any scratch rapidly
            becoming a suppurating mess. Everyone, it seemed wore bandages.</p>
